Why Another Roman Numeral Conversion Package?

This package offers Roman numeral conversions in Unicode encoding
which other packages do not offer at the time of this writing.
Additionally, the Convert::Number::Roman package applies the algorithm
in the CSS3-List module recommendation which works for a wide range
of integers:

The interface of the Convert::Number::Roman package is identical to
other Convert::Number:: packages such as ::Ethiopic and ::Coptic.

Presently the package works best with Perl 5.8.0, it has not been
satisfactorily tested on older versions.
